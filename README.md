# KADARIVENU_RISC-V_WEEK-41. Velocity Saturation in MOSFETs

Concept:
At high electric fields (short-channel devices), carrier velocity no longer increases linearly with the electric field ‚Äî it saturates at a maximum drift velocity (~10‚Å∑ cm/s for electrons in Si).

Effects:

Drain current increases less rapidly with VDS ‚Üí reduces transconductance (gm).

Reduces drive current ‚Üí slower switching in digital circuits.

Lowers the gain of analog circuits.

Shifts CMOS inverter‚Äôs switching point (VM) slightly due to reduced mobility.

Key takeaway:
Velocity saturation is a short-channel effect limiting performance in modern nanometer nodes. It is a key reason why MOSFET scaling faces physical limits.

‚öôÔ∏è 2. CMOS Inverter and Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC)

Concept:
A CMOS inverter consists of a PMOS pull-up and NMOS pull-down.
The Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) is the plot of Vout vs Vin, showing how the inverter switches.

Regions:

Region 1: Vin ‚âà 0 ‚Üí NMOS off, PMOS on ‚Üí Vout ‚âà VDD

Region 2: Vin increases ‚Üí both partially on ‚Üí transition region

Region 3: Vin ‚âà VDD ‚Üí NMOS on, PMOS off ‚Üí Vout ‚âà 0

Key Parameters:

VM (Switching Threshold): Vin where Vout = Vin

NMH / NML: High and low noise margins from VTC

Gain (‚àídVout/dVin): Steep slope ‚áí high noise immunity

Takeaway:
The CMOS inverter‚Äôs VTC defines logic level stability, noise immunity, and signal restoration ability.

üß™ 3. SPICE Simulation for Lower Nodes & Velocity Saturation

Concept:
SPICE simulations help model transistor behavior accurately under short-channel effects at nanometer scales.

Simulations include:

I‚ÄìV curves (DC): Show velocity saturation (ID flattens for high VDS).

VTC (DC sweep): Evaluate logic thresholds and noise margins.

Transient (Dynamic): Observe switching speed, short-circuit current, power, and delay.

Device models: BSIM4, BSIM-CMG (FinFET) include velocity saturation, DIBL, etc.

Takeaway:
SPICE provides quantitative verification of short-channel effects and allows performance tuning (e.g., sizing, load optimization).

‚ö° 4. CMOS Switching Threshold & Dynamic Simulation

Concept:
Dynamic simulations (transient analysis) analyze inverter operation when input transitions occur.

Measurements:

tpHL / tpLH: Propagation delays (50% input ‚Üí 50% output).

tr / tf: Output rise/fall times (10‚Äì90%).

VM: Switching threshold voltage (from DC or transient).

Ishort / Dynamic Power: Short-circuit and capacitive energy losses.

Observations:

Balance PMOS/NMOS (Œ≤ ratio) ‚Üí symmetric VM (~VDD/2).

Delay ‚àù (CL √ó VDD) / IDsat

Velocity saturation ‚Üí reduces IDsat ‚Üí increases delay.

Takeaway:
Dynamic simulations are essential for timing, power, and performance evaluation of CMOS circuits.

üßÆ 5. CMOS Noise Margin & Robustness Evaluation (Power Supply & Device Variation)

Concept:
CMOS circuits must remain functional despite supply voltage variations, device mismatches, and temperature changes.

Evaluations:

Static Robustness:

Compute NMH/NML from VTC at various corners (PVT ‚Äì Process, Voltage, Temperature).

Verify logic levels remain valid even at low VDD or high temperature.

Dynamic Robustness:

Simulate delay, power, and VM shift vs. VDD, Temp, and device variation (ŒîVth, L, W).

Add supply droops/noise in transient simulation.

Metrics:

ŒîVM/ŒîVDD (supply sensitivity)

Delay degradation vs. VDD (%)

Worst-case NM and leakage

Takeaway:
Robustness evaluation ensures reliable operation under real-world conditions (aging, IR drop, PVT spread).
