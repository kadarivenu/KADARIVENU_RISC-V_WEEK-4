Basic Concept

An NMOS transistor controls current flow between the drain (D) and source (S) using the gate voltage (VGS).

VGS → controls how strongly the channel conducts.

VDS → controls how much voltage is dropped across the channel.

ID → is the resulting drain current.

📉 Three Operating Regions
1. Cutoff Region (VGS < Vth)

Condition: Gate voltage is below the threshold voltage (Vth).

Channel not formed, so no current flows.

Drain current (ID ≈ 0).

Acts like an open switch.

ID = 0

2. Linear (Ohmic) Region (VGS > Vth and VDS < VGS − Vth)

Channel is formed and acts like a variable resistor.

Current increases linearly with VDS.

Transistor behaves like a voltage-controlled resistor.

ID = μn Cox (W/L) [(VGS − Vth) VDS − (VDS² / 2)]

3. Saturation Region (VDS ≥ VGS − Vth)

Channel is pinched off near the drain.

Increasing VDS further doesn’t increase ID much — it saturates.

Used for amplifier or switch operation.

ID(sat) = (1/2) μn Cox (W/L) (VGS − Vth)²

Each curve corresponds to a different VGS value.

Higher VGS → higher ID.
